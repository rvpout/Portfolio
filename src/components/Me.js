                    <p>I am 23 years old student from Turku. Things I like to do 
                        in my free time are moving outside and cook. I'm really 
                        positive and like hanging out with people. What my 
                        past working experiences has taught me is patience 
                        in high pressure situations. I'v worked in teams as I have 
                        alone.
